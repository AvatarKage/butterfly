# BUTTERFLY LICENSE – VERSION 0.5 (BL-V0.5)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but modifying it is not allowed.

## 1. DEFINITIONS

- **"Content"** means any work or material provided under this license, in any
  form or medium, including associated files, assets, media, documentation, or
  other included components, unless stated otherwise.

- **"Derivative Work"** means any modification, adaptation, translation, remix,
  or other work based on the Content.

- **"Author"** means the original creator(s) of the Content.

- **"Holder"** means the individual or entity that currently owns the copyright
  to the Content, whether the Author or a successor in interest.

- **"You"** and **"Your"** mean any person or entity exercising rights under
  this license.

## 2. LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the terms of this license, the Holder grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Content in
personal-use projects.

This license applies only to Content expressly made available under these
terms. A copy of this license must always accompany the Content and may not be
removed, modified, or obscured.

You may:

- Use the Content in personal, educational, or creative projects.
- Create Derivative Works from the Content.
- Distribute projects incorporating the Content, provided proper attribution is
  given and the Content is not redistributed as a standalone work.

## 3. PERMITTED USES

This license always permits use of the Content in non-commercial projects. A project is considered non-commercial when access is freely provided,
without paywalls, fees, or intent to generate income from access to the project
itself.

### Commercial Use

Limited commercial use is permitted only under these conditions:

- The Content is included solely as a minor component of a larger project.
- The Content is not the primary product being sold or monetized.
- Access to the project and the Content remains free.

Permitted monetization methods include:

- Third-party advertising revenue
- Voluntary support platforms
- Optional in-app purchases or paid features

Any commercial use beyond these limits requires prior written permission from
the Holder.

## 4. DISTRIBUTION

Distribution is considered as making the Content or any Derivative Work available to the public, whether directly or as part of a larger project, including reuploading, rehosting, or embedding from existing sources. Redistribution is permitted only when the Content is not made available as a
standalone work. 


You may not:
- Provide the Content as a direct download, file, or separate asset.
- Rehost, republish, or embed the Content independently of a larger project.
- Distribute minimally modified versions of the Content (including, but not limited to minor edits,
  remasters, re-encodes, pitch or distortion changes, recolorations, format
  conversions, translations, ports, asset swaps, or other superficial
  alterations) in a manner intended to replace, substitute, or compete with the
  Holder's Distribution.

### Monetized Platforms

On supported monetized distribution platforms that enables creators to use existing publications as part of their projects, distribution is permitted only
through platform-provided embedding to the Holder’s
designated source location. If no such official source exists, no
redistribution rights are granted.

### Non-Monetized Platforms

On non-monetized platforms, redistribution is allowed only when the Content is
bundled internally within a project in a manner not directly accessible outside
normal project use.

### Derivative Works

Distribution of Derivative Works is allowed only with proper attribution and
only when the work is clearly identified as modified, adapted, or remixed, such
that it cannot reasonably be mistaken for the original Content.

You may not claim ownership, authorship outside of Your own modifications, or present any Derivative Work as
official. Titles, labels, and descriptions must clearly indicate that the work
is derivative.

## 5. RESTRICTIONS

You may not:

- Use the Content for illegal, exploitative, or harmful purposes.
- Claim ownership or authorship of the Content.
- Redistribute, resell, reupload, or package the Content as a standalone work,
  including minimally modified versions.
- Use the Content in compilation projects intended primarily to provide access
  to the Content or substitute the original distribution.
- Use the Content in connection with unethical, deceptive, or exploitative AI
  systems, including training without written Author approval.
- Use the Content in ways that intentionally harm or misrepresent the Author’s
  or Holder’s reputation, identity, or brand.
- Remove, alter, or conceal this license or required attribution.

## 6. ATTRIBUTION

Any public use or distribution of the Content or Derivative Works must include
reasonable attribution, including:

- The title or identifier of the Content, if applicable
- The Author's name or pseudonym
- The Holder's entity copyright notice, if applicable
- Reference to this license and its document or URL

or Author unless explicitly granted in writing.

## 7. DISCLAIMER

IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE HOLDER, AUTHOR, AND ANY
ASSOCIATED PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE HOLDER, AUTHOR, OR THEIR ASSOCIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE,
DISTRIBUTION, OR OTHER DEALINGS WITH THE CONTENT.

## 8. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Holder, Author, and their
associates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses arising
from Your use, modification, or distribution of the Content.

## 9. TERMINATION

Upon termination, You must immediately cease all use of the Content and remove
all copies in Your possession or control.

## 10. REQUESTING PERMISSIONS

Any use not expressly permitted under this license requires prior written
consent from the Holder. Granting permissions is at the Holder’s sole
discretion.

## 11. AUTHOR RIGHTS AND HOLDER LIMITATIONS

Regardless of any transfer of copyright ownership, the Author retains the
perpetual right to display, reference, and reproduce the Content for portfolio,
archival, and self-promotional purposes, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in
writing.

If the Holder is not the Author, the Holder may not relicense, replace, or
redistribute the Content under different terms without the Author’s prior
written consent.
